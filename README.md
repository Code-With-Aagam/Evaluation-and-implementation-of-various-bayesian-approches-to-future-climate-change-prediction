# Evaluation and implementation of various bayesian approaches to future climate change prediction

This project explores weather forecasting using machine learning models, specifically a Bayesian neural network and an LSTM network. It involves scraping historical weather data, cleaning and preprocessing it, and then training and evaluating the models to predict future weather patterns in Estes Park, Colorado.

## Project Motivation

Accurate weather forecasting is crucial for various applications, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. Traditional forecasting methods often rely on complex physical models, which can be computationally expensive and require extensive domain expertise. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to build more efficient and accurate weather forecasting models.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Collection:** Historical weather data is scraped from the EstesParkWeather.net website, which provides daily weather summaries for Estes Park, Colorado. This data is obtained using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries in Python, enabling automated extraction of weather information from the website's HTML structure.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The raw data is cleaned to handle inconsistencies and errors. Missing values are addressed using appropriate techniques, such as forward fill or imputation. Relevant features, including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and precipitation, are extracted and transformed into a suitable format for model training.
3. **Model Development:** 
    * **Bayesian Neural Network:** A Bayesian neural network is implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability. This model incorporates uncertainty in predictions by representing model parameters as probability distributions, providing a more robust and reliable forecast.
    * **LSTM Network:** An LSTM network is implemented using Keras to capture temporal dependencies in the weather data. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for time-series data as they can learn long-term patterns and relationships in the sequence of weather observations.
4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization:** The models are trained using a portion of the historical weather data and evaluated on a separate validation set. Metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to assess the models' accuracy in predicting future weather conditions. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the models' performance, and results are visualized to gain insights into the data and model behavior.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `NumPy`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `TensorFlow Probability`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecasting.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Weather_Forecasting.ipynb` to execute the code.

## Results

The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning for weather forecasting. The Bayesian neural network and LSTM models achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting various weather parameters, showing promising results for further development and refinement. The visualizations generated provide valuable insights into the data and model behavior, aiding in understanding the factors influencing weather patterns.

## Future Work

* Explore alternative model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or hybrid models, to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
* Incorporate additional weather-related features, such as wind direction, solar radiation, and cloud cover, to enhance the models' understanding of atmospheric conditions.
* Deploy the model as a web application or API to provide real-time weather forecasts to users.
* Investigate the use of ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models, further improving forecasting robustness.
